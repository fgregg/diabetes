In an earlier analysis, we found that on average a respondent's Wave 2
HbA1C measure was lower than her Wave 1 measure, and that this
pattern held among subgroups with different diabetes statuses. Most
troubling, even among nondiabetics, the measure of HbA1C was, on
average, lower at the second Wave. From previous literature, we
expected that HbA1C should increase among the nondiabetic population.

The most relevant prior study is a 2008 study by Lydie Pani and her
co-authors.\footnote{Pani, Lydie N., Leslie Korenda, James B. Meigs,
  Cynthia Driver, Shadi Chamany, Caroline S. Fox, Lisa Sullivan, Ralph
  B. D'Agostino, and David M. Nathan. 2008. ``Effect of Aging on A1C
  Levels in Individuals Without Diabetes.'' \textit{Diabetes Care} 31
  (10) (October): 1991â€“1996. \url{doi:10.2337/dc08-0577}.  } Looking
at longitudinal data from the Framingham Heart Study, they found an
average annual increase in HbA1c among non-diabetics (Table
\ref{tab:framingham}). As the Framingham study is a community study,
we might be cautious of extrapolating these results to the entire
population. However, it is the best longitudinal study to date and,
unlike our data, they controlled for drift in their measurements by
storing long-term reference samples. In any case, the results of the
Framingham study align with patterns found in national and
international cross-sectional analyses.

increase.hba1c <- c(0.027, 0.032, 0.037, 0.043, 0.024, 0.024, 0.030, 0.026)

# Longitudinal, 
@ 

Given that we do not have long-term reference samples, problems in
measurement are the most likely explanation for our average drop in
HbA1C. 

Assuming that is true, we might want to know if the differences
between Wave 1 and Wave 2 measures are relatively simple and
consistent. If the differences are just due to a consistent shift or
scaling factor, then we might be able to correct for these difference.

\subsubsection*{Null Model}
So, let us investigate this. Let's make our life a little easier and
only consider what is happening to the HbA1c of nondiabetics. From the
literature we have some expectation about what should happen with this
population. In contrast, we have no expectations from the literature on how we should expect HbA1C to develop among diabetics. We will define nondiabetics as respondents who 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Had HbA1C levels below 6.5 at both waves.
  \item Not diagnosed with diabetes at either wave
\end{itemize}

First, we need to posit a model of what we would expect if there were
no measurement problems between the waves. Let's make the simple
assumption that, for each respondent, their annual rate of change is
drawn from a normal distribution. 

Under this model, we would expect that if we modeled Wave 2 Hba1C
measures as scaled and shifted Wave 1 HbA1c measures, then the
residuals of that model should follow a normal distribution.

That's exactly what we find (Figures \ref{fig:qqplot} and \ref{fig:hist}).

<<linearModel, cache=F, results=tex>>=
nondiabetics <- complete[complete$w1.diabetes.status == "Nondiabetic" &
                         complete$interim.diagnosed == FALSE &
                         as.numeric(as.character(complete$w2.hba1c.dried)) <= 6.5,]

lin.model <- lm(as.numeric(as.character(w2.hba1c.dried)) ~ grandMeanCenter(w1.hba1c), nondiabetics)
lin.model.summ <- xtable(summary(lin.model),
                         caption="Model of Wave 2 Hba1C. Wave 1 HbA1C has been Grand Mean Centered")
rownames(lin.model.summ) <- c("Intercept", "Wave 1 HbA1C")
print(lin.model.summ)

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!]
<<hist, cache=F, fig=TRUE>>=
hist(lin.model$resid, nclass=60, main="Histogram of Residuals", xlab="Residuals", probability=TRUE)
norm.fit <- fitdistr(lin.model$resid, "normal")

lines(x, dnorm(x, norm.fit$estimate[1], norm.fit$estimate[2]))
@ 
\caption{Histogram of Residuals}
\label{fig:hist}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Diabetics}
If we try to extend our shift and scale model to `Diabetics,' then our
residuals very quickly start looking non-normal (Figure
\ref{fig:qqplotall}). But, it's not all that surprising that the HbA1C
of diabetics should follow a different course.

<<linearModelAll, cache=F>>=
lin.model <- lm(as.numeric(as.character(w2.hba1c.dried)) ~ grandMeanCenter(w1.hba1c), complete)
@ 

\begin{figure}

qqline(lin.model$resid)
@ 
\caption{Quantile-Quantile Plot of Residuals Against a Normal Distribution with Same Mean and Variance, including `diabetics'}
\label{fig:qqplotall}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Discussion}
So, what are we to make of the fact that, for nondiabetics, a scale
and shift model seems to fit the differences between Wave1 and Wave2
HbA1C very well?

If we felt confident that the results of Framingham study could be
applied to the NSHAP sample, we could transform our data so that
distribution of our longitudinal changes matches their changes. 

That's a big if.
